                </h2>
                <p><em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw" title="Swahili Board Game">Bao la Kiswahili</em> is a traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala">mancala<sup><span alt="Wikipedia W logo" style="font-size: 0.5rem;" class="fab fa-wikipedia-w fa-xs"></span></sup></a> game played in East Africa, primarily by the Swahili people of the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts. The game is well-known as one of the most complex mancalas and mastering the game bestows one with high respect. Each player exclusively controls two rows of eight <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">mashimo</em>, or ‚Äúholes.‚Äù The fourth pit in each player's inner lap is the <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">nyumba</em>, or ‚Äúhouse,‚Äù often distinguished by its square shape in contrast to the other, circular pits. Each player begins the game with 32 <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">kete</em> (‚Äúshells‚Äù) and tries to reduce their opponent‚Äôs possessions.</p>
                <p>This is all one needs to know in order to construct a board; however, the rules of <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw" title="Swahili Board Game">Bao</em> are far more complex than elaborated here. More information can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bao_(game)" title="Wikipedia (en): ‚ÄúBao (game)‚Äù">on Wikipedia</a> or, incredibly, the mancala wiki called ‚Äú<a title="Mancala World: ‚ÄúBao la Kiswahili‚Äù" href="http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Bao_la_Kiswahili">Mancala World</a>‚Äù.</p>

                <p>Measure out the locations for your cuts. I recommend using a speed square and compass to draw perfect circles on your lumber in the exact locations where you intend to cut; however, I had neither &ndash; so I created a template of seven circles and a square in Illustrator and transferred it to the wood.</p>

                    <p>Using the straight bit, I began boring out the circular markings. Taking care to never dig too deap for fear of overheating the router, I made repeated cuts about 1/8" deep &ndash; extending the router depth each time.</p>
                    <p>For the final depth, I used the round bit around the bottom rim of each circle in order to make a smooth curve. The interior of the bottom &ndash; not the rounded edges &ndash; was then smoothed with the straight bit.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I used the round-over bit on the top lip of each <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">mshimo</em> in order to get a round, smooth edge.</p>

                    <p>In order to fit hinges that would close tightly, I cut shallow grooves along the inner edge of each board.</p>
                    <p>My grooves were a bit too deep for the continuous hinges I bought, and thus the hinges undergo excess strain when closed. I recommend you ensure the grooves are just deep enough to allow the hinge to be fully closed and nothing more.</p>

                <p>I first sanded the boards thoroghly by hand, taking care to get the insides of each <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">mshimo</em>).</p>
                <p>After sanding, I stained the boards. The stain I used as depicted in the photo at right was Varathane's Traditional Cherry. Of course, there is no proscribed ‚Äútraditional‚Äù color of <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">Bao</em> boards, and regardless, no lumber you‚Äôre getting at a North American Home Depot is going to be the same as in East Africa.</p>
                <p>The method I found most effective for applying stain (which I only perfected by the second board) was to get a brush soaked in stain and heavily lather the inner vertical edge of one <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">mshimo</em> at a time. This method allowed the stain to flow nad fill the bottom of the <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">mshimo</em> quickly, allowing me to rapidly sop up the stain without excess absorption.</p>
