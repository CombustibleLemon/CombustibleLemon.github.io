                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
                <p><em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw" title="Swahili Board Game">Bao la Kiswahili</em> is a traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala">mancala<sup><span alt="Wikipedia W logo" style="font-size: 0.5rem;" class="fab fa-wikipedia-w fa-xs"></span></sup></a> game played in East Africa, primarily by the Swahili people of the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts. The game is well-known as one of the most complex mancalas and mastering the game bestows one with high respect. Each player exclusively controls two rows of eight <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">mashimo</em>, or “holes.” The fourth pit in each player's inner lap is the <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">nyumba</em>, or “house,” often distinguished by its square shape in contrast to the other, circular pits. Each player begins the game with 32 <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">kete</em> (“shells”) and tries to reduce their opponent’s possessions.</p>
                <p>This is all one needs to know in order to construct a board; however, the rules of <em lang="sw" xml:lang="sw" title="Swahili Board Game">Bao</em> are far more complex than elaborated here. More information can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bao_(game)" title="Wikipedia (en): “Bao (game)”">on Wikipedia</a> or, incredibly, the mancala wiki called “<a title="Mancala World: “Bao la Kiswahili”" href="http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Bao_la_Kiswahili">Mancala World</a>”.</p>

                <ul>
			<li>Two identical pieces of lumber sized to 1:4 ratio<br/>I used two 2×12 boards about 48 in long; however, this became quite bulky and I would reccommend 2×10×40.</li>
