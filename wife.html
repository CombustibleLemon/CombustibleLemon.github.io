                I figure if I’m going to be within shooting distance of you, I
                better try some diplomacy before I arrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know this is all crazy for you, it’s all crazy for me, and
                it’s double crazy for Laura, who is the person I’m trying to
                protect and accommodate most of all in this process. People
                fall in love and people fall out of love and love changes all
                the time, but rarely for one person do they have so many things
                to consider, so many people to love, give attention to, and
                please as Laura does.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s also rare to come across the one person you truly believe
                you’re meant to be with, and not only have her married and with
                kids to boot, but also 2000 miles away in another sovereign
                nation. This isn’t a fling or a tryst or an affair, it’s two
                people bring bowled over by discovering a deep wellspring of
                powerful emotions, and a connection that they never thought
                possible. I don’t covet Laura, want to make her mine alone, or
                steal her away as much as I want to find any way possible to be
                in her light and warmth, and to nurture her, protect her, and
                grow with her, for me, and for everyone else, as much as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t judge people, ever. Laura doesn’t badmouth you, you’re
                not some loser guy we scheme against in our private
                conversations. Through everything she’s shown that she loves
                you deeply and wants to continue a large portion of the life
                you’ve built together with Asa, but also explore and grow in
                other ways. It was hard for me to accept at first too, but I’ve
                done so, because again, she’s just that god damned incredible a
                human being.
            </p>
            <p>
                So yeah. That’s where we are. I don’t expect or anticipate a
                response, our relationship can be as distant or as friendly as
                we want going forward, when things are settled and comfortable
                and people adjusted. Life is crazy, and hard, but most unfair
                of all, short, and these connections and emotions don’t reveal
                themselves every day, it’d be so self-damaging not to pursue it,
                it’s a thought I can’t even tolerate, and I think you’ll find
                Laura feels the same way, and what’s more will have the chance
                to grow and explore in other ways that she can share with
                everyone she loves.
