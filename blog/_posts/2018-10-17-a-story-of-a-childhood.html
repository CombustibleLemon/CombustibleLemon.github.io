    Today a story was regaled to me, a recollection from a man’s childhood.
    It is a tale of magic, a beautiful African story of the world being more mysterious than one could possibly understand.
</p>

<p>I present it here for your enjoyment.</p>

        As a child, we went through many spells of drought, where the crops 
        would wither and the wild animals would <span style="color: red;">be 
        nowhere to be</span> found. I came to notice that my neighbor would 
        never seem to be hungry, always as lively as ever despite the 
        desolation surrounding us all. I asked why, and learned that he had the
        ability to transform into an animal. During drought, he would simply 
        become a porcupine and eat whatever it is that porcupines eat. It is 
        this magic one finds in Africa that defies all logic, yet it is true.

        As a schoolchild, we witnessed many shows and plays, as I am sure you
        yourself have in your own education. One of these left a permanent mark
        on me. Two great birds were fighting to the death onstage, in front of
        the whole student body. But these were no ordinary birds.
        One was my neighbor, who had transformed himself into a great bird.
        I forget the English name, but it is similar to what you call a goose
        yet massive. We used to have them here in Nairobi, 
        but they are certainly prevalent where I grew up. 
        His opponent was a man who had transformed himself into
        a hawk, and the two fought fiercely. Once my neighbor had mortally
        wounded his opponent, they transformed back into men. My neighbor,
        standing proud and victorious in his original form, stood over
        his opponent. He then urinated over the dying man, releasing a waterfall
        of yellow that lasted nearly three hours. As we students watched, the
        the losing party drowned in his opponent’s urine. The victor transformed
        back into the mighty bird, and flew out a window. I never saw him again.
